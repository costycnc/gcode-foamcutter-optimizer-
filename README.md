# GCode Path Optimizer

This script reads a G-code file generated by **LaserGRBL**, analyzes the paths, merges them into a single optimized path starting from `[0,0]`, visualizes it, and saves the resulting G-code to a new file.

---

## Key Features

- Reads G-code files (`.nc`) containing `G00`, `G0`, `G01`, and `G1` commands.
- Parses X and Y coordinates of linear movements.
- Visualizes the final path using `matplotlib`.
- Saves the optimized path into a new G-code file, ready for CNC or laser use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `re` (standard library)
  - `math` (standard library)

Install the required library:
